# Roadmap-Stage Implementation

Use this entrypoint when a roadmap-stage implementation plan exists and Codex
should implement its phases through branch/worktree creation, validation, PRs,
CI-gated merges, metadata updates, and cleanup.

The managing agent must perform the implementation-plan quality gate as the
first workflow preflight before selecting or assigning any phase. The quality
gate is automatic workflow behavior, not a separate user-facing entrypoint.

"Perform" means:

1. Read the selected implementation plan's Plan quality gate section.
2. If the gate is missing, incomplete, stale, ambiguous, or not passed for the
   current plan content, run the review/refinement/confirmation sequence using
   the implementation-plan prompts listed below.
3. If the gate already records a current passed result, verify that evidence and
   continue.
4. Stop before phase planning if blocking plan findings remain.

When the implementation plan cites roadmap-stage planning, the quality
gate must also verify planning readiness: design-safety review completed or
accepted risks recorded, validation strategy and phase shaping carried into the
plan, and no unresolved `blocked` or `needs discussion` planning decisions.

User request shape:

```text
Use .codex/workflows/roadmap-stage-implementation.md.
Begin or continue implementation of docs/roadmap/stage-<id>/implementation-plan.md.
Use Codex-managed automatic merges. Do not gate implementation on human PR
review.
```

Manager responsibilities:

- Read `AGENTS.md`, the selected implementation plan, existing phase artifacts,
  and `.codex/templates/README.md`.
- Perform the plan quality gate before phase selection or implementation.
- Select one phase at a time.
- Use `/home/samcantrill/work/weave-worktrees` for phase worktrees.
- Use fast path unless expanded-path triggers apply.
- Run or record `make validate-pr` and `make test-summary`.
- Open phase PRs with explicit base/head/title.
- Poll CI and merge eligible phase PRs into `develop` without waiting for human
  approval; use admin merge authority for review-only branch protection when
  available after automated gates pass.
- Record merge metadata in the implementation plan and clean up phase branches
  and worktrees when safe.
