## Objective

State the phase objective in one concise paragraph.

## Full-Plan Context

Summarize how this phase fits into earlier and later phases. Name future-phase
work that must remain out of scope.

## Stack Context

- Root or stacked phase:
- Current predecessor branch or PR:
- Why this base branch is correct:
- Retarget/rebase plan after predecessor merge:
- Branch cleanup constraints:

## Source Phase Summary

- Goal:
- Required scope:
- Required checkpoints:
- Acceptance criteria:

## Current Source And Harness Findings

- Existing files or modules that constrain this phase:
- Existing tests or harness behavior:
- Import-boundary or dependency constraints:

## In-Scope Work

- TBD

## Out-of-Scope Work

- TBD

## Assumptions

- TBD

## Scope Contract

Define the public behavior, module boundaries, data shapes, error behavior, and
edge cases the executor must not redesign. Keep this to decisions that affect
scope or public behavior; do not describe routine code edits. If no public
contract changes are in scope, state that explicitly.

## Design Impact

- Maintainability:
- Extensibility:
- Domain neutrality:
- Source-tree boundaries:

## Future Compatibility

- TBD

## Alternatives Rejected

| Alternative | Reason rejected |
| --- | --- |
|  |  |

## Debt Introduced

| Debt | Reason accepted | Revisit trigger |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  |  |  |

## Reviewability

- Expected PR size and shape:
- Files and areas to inspect:
- Scope-control checks:

## Implementation Steps

List three to six small, reviewable implementation slices. Avoid line-by-line
instructions unless needed to prevent a public-contract or scope error.

1. TBD

## Test Plan

### E2E Suite

- Expected paths:
- Required assertions or deferral reason:

### Opt-In Suites

- Status: required/deferred
- Markers affected:
- Required assertions or deferral reason:

## Risks

- TBD

## Validation Commands

Targeted development commands:

```sh

```

Final PR-preparation commands:

```sh
make validate-pr
make test-summary
```

## Handoff Notes For `weave_phase_executor`

- Safe implementation slices:
- Tests to run with each slice:
- Decisions the executor must not revisit:
- Conditions that require stopping for the manager:

## Refinement And Review Budget Status

- Phase implementation refinement: unused
- PR review: unused
- Blocker resolution: 0/3 used
