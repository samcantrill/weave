You are refining the PR body for the completed phase.
This prompt is intended for the `weave_pr_preparer` custom agent.

This expanded-path PR body pass is used only when the manager selected the
expanded path or the fast-path PR body could not be made accurate enough in one
pass. Work from the durable PR body artifact, the phase execution plan, the
actual diff, and validation evidence. The result must be accurate enough to
open or hand off the PR without relying on hidden draft-pass context.

Read:

- `AGENTS.md`
- The source implementation plan recorded in the phase execution plan
- The phase execution plan in `docs/roadmap/stage-<id>/phases/`
- The draft PR body at `docs/roadmap/stage-<id>/phases/<summary-of-feature>-pr-body.md`
- The current diff
- Validation results
- `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md`
- `.codex/templates/phase-pr-body.md`

Task:

1. Confirm you are inside the dedicated git worktree for this phase under
   `/home/samcantrill/work/weave-worktrees`.
2. Confirm the branch name follows `codex/<summary-of-feature>`.
3. Verify the PR body matches the phase execution plan, implementation diff,
   acceptance criteria, suite evidence, scope boundaries, assumptions, and risks.
4. Confirm future phases were not implemented early and no unrelated refactors
   are described as phase work.
5. Mark the PR body refine pass complete.
6. Open the PR if GitHub tooling and authentication are available. Use explicit
   `--base <target-branch>`, `--head codex/<summary-of-feature>`, and
   `--title "<plan-focus> - Phase <N>: <what-changed> E.g. Configuration - Phase 1: Boundary and Artifact Contracts "` flags from the
   phase execution plan. Otherwise, leave the PR body ready to use and document
   the exact blocker in phase notes.
7. Verify an opened PR with `gh pr view <PR>
   --json baseRefName,headRefName,state,url` and confirm `baseRefName` matches
   the recorded target branch. Document whether the PR is already
   merge-eligible (`develop` target) or stacked for review only (predecessor
   branch target) in phase notes.
8. Do not request GitHub reviewers or add human-review gating language. The
   managing agent owns automated review, CI polling, and merge after PR
   preparation.
9. Keep workflow internals such as PR verification JSON, notification fallback,
   commit lists, and budget accounting out of the public PR body.

Rules:

- Do not merge.
- Do not approve the PR.
- Do not request GitHub reviewers or block the PR on human approval.
- Do not run this pass for routine fast-path phases.
- Do not perform implementation refinements.
- Do not create new test coverage.
- Do not add broad implementation narrative beyond what reviewers need to
  verify scope, behavior, tests, and risks.
- Ensure Implementation Notes describe the technical behavior changed and the
  new or changed tests that validate it.
- Do not retarget or rebase stack branches; the managing agent owns stack
  maintenance after predecessor PRs land.
- If the PR body cannot be made accurate from the artifact, diff, and validation
  evidence, report the blocker to the manager and stop.
