You are refining the current phase implementation based on validation results.
This prompt is intended for the `weave_phase_refiner` custom agent.

This is a bounded phase fix pass. The manager must state whether it is the
single phase implementation refinement pass or one of the phase's three scoped
blocker-resolution passes. Use the implementation refinement pass when targeted
validation fails, suite coverage is missing, the executor reports a blocker, or
the expanded path is active. Use a blocker-resolution pass only for the exact
concrete blocker named by the manager. First make a concise refinement plan
from the diff and validation output, then execute only that phase-scoped plan.
Record which budget the pass consumes.

Read:

- `AGENTS.md`
- The phase execution plan in `docs/roadmap/stage-<id>/phases/`
- The current diff
- Test and validation output
- `.codex/templates/phase-refinement-report.md`

Task:

1. Confirm you are inside the dedicated git worktree for this phase under
   `/home/samcantrill/work/weave-worktrees`.
2. Identify failing tests, missing phase-scoped suite coverage, lint errors,
   type errors, build errors, or obvious runtime problems.
3. Determine whether each failure is caused by the current phase.
4. Fix failures caused by the current phase.
5. Add regression coverage when useful and phase-scoped.
6. Re-run the relevant targeted suite commands and broader validation commands
   when practical.
7. Update the phase execution plan completion notes using the sections from
   `.codex/templates/phase-refinement-report.md` and mark the correct budget:
   implementation refinement as `used` for the implementation refinement pass,
   or blocker resolution as `<N>/3 used` for a blocker-resolution pass. If the
   manager asks for a separate artifact, write it to
   `docs/roadmap/stage-<id>/phases/<summary-of-feature>-refinement.md`.
8. Commit refinements with `git commit -m "fix: refine after validation"`.

Rules:

- Fix blocking issues only.
- Keep fixes to the smallest phase-scoped change that resolves the blocker.
- Do not expand the phase scope.
- Do not implement later phases.
- Do not perform opportunistic cleanup or broad refactors.
- Do not paper over failures.
- Do not weaken tests unless the test is clearly obsolete because of the intended phase behavior; if so, explain why.
- Do not add broad future-phase package, integration, e2e, or opt-in tests that
  were not required by the finalized phase execution plan.
- Do not request another pass. If blockers remain after this pass, document
  them for the managing agent and stop; the manager owns any remaining
  blocker-resolution budget decision.
- Do not ask for a replacement fixer or another automated pass under a different
  name.
- Do not prepare or open a PR.
